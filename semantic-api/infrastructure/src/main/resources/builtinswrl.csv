swrlb:equal;Equal;Satisfied iff the first argument and the second argument are the same.;
swrlb:notEqual;Not Equal;The negation of swrlb:equal.;
swrlb:lessThan;Less Than;Satisfied iff the first argument and the second argument are both in some implemented type and the first argument is less than the second argument according to a type-specific ordering (partial or total), if there is one defined for the type. The ordering function for the type of untyped literals is the partial order defined as string ordering when the language tags are the same (or both missing) and incomparable otherwise.;
swrlb:lessThanOrEqual;Less Than Or Equal;Either less than, as above, or equal, as above.;
swrlb:greaterThan;Greater Than;Similarly to swrlb:lessThan.;
swrlb:greaterThanOrEqual;Greater Than Or Equal;Similarly to swrlb:lessThanOrEqual.;
swrlb:stringEqualIgnoreCase;String Equal Ignore Case;Satisfied iff the first argument is the same as the second argument (upper/lower case ignored);
swrlb:booleanNot;Boolean Not;Satisfied iff the first argument is true and the second argument is false, or vice versa.;
